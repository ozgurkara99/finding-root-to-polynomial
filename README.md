You should compile the cpp file with writing into terminal "g++ main.cpp -o main.exe". It creates an executable file. Then you can run this exe file, on the command prompt with writing 
"main.exe [n+1 inputs for coefficients] x0 x1 tolerance" where you should write the coefficients, x0, x1 tolerance.
This program basically reads a polynomial function and find a root between x0 and x1 with given tolerance by using secant, bisection and hybrid method.
